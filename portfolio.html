<center> <p> In the early stages of our project, my parner and I decided to 
create a story, with some similar game feaures. We decided to make a story
because we waned to incorporate our goals in life, with an actual story involving
both of us.Our story allows the user to choose decisions, based on options 
presented to him or her. The user then must, use the direcional arows on the
keyboard, then decide on which choice to select. In all, our story runs on two
main algorithms. One being the lateral and horizonal movement, and the other
being the money falling loop in the end. A clear abstraction that we used was 
the movement using the directional arrows. We had to set the speed along the 
x and y axis. Click on the picture above in order to play are game. </p>

<font size="6"> <font face="helvetica"> </font> App Inventor Project </p>
<font size="4"> <font face="helvetica"> </font>
<center> <p> Our app was a tribute to the old game 'flappy bird'. We implimented 
the games old controls and principles, and effectively recrated the game with
our own touch. We used AppInventor in order to code this project. AppInventor
is an application that utilizes the Andriod interface, and the code was relatively
straightforward. One thing our team struggled on was effectively programming
the swords to kill Kirby. The corners of the swords were still hitting Kirby, 
even if he cleared the sword without touching it. We diagnosed our problem
and found that the actual border of the image of the sword was still touching 
Kirby. We fixed this by recropping the image and reuploading it on AppInventor. </p>

<p> This is our beginning or intro screeen, as soon as you open up the app.  </p>

<p>This next screen is directions on how to play the game and steps in how to 
use them effectively.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/3.PNG" height="300">
<p>This is the actual game screen. The player must effectively manuever through
the swords, and after he passes each one, there is a counter. Once the player
dies, his score will be displayed. The player can continually make attempts in
hopes of improving his score. </p>

create and effectively run this app. </p>

<font size="6"> <font face="helvetica"> </font> Python Story Project </p>
<font size="4"> <font face="helvetica"> </font>
<center> <p> Our story was based off a Pirates of the Caribbean, and served as 
a fan made prequel of the movie series. Our program was written in Python and 
was coded in Replit. Our code mainly consisted of decidable problems, and branched
into different outcomes, based on the user/players inputs. The coding sprints
for this story were relatively straightforward and did not pose any intanglible
problems my partner and I could not solve. </p>

<font size="4"> <font face="helvetica"> </font>
<center> <p> This Image Artist Editor was utilized using Python. My partner and 
I created a code that allowed us to roll any image and switch the color. By 
utilizing our code, we were able to successfully alter and edit two different
images with very different colors. Our code revoled around two simple 
algorithms, one that rolled the image at 45, and the other that changes the 
rolled image into black and white. Two examples are shown below.  </p>

<font size="4"> <font face="helvetica"> </font>
<img src="images/melissa slide.PNG" height="300">
<center> <p>Our malware presentation was based on the Melissa Virus. The Melissa Virus 
was a virus that infected millions of computers in early 1999. The Melissa 
Virus disables a number of safeguards in Word 97 or Word 2000, and if the 
user has the Microsoft Outlook e-mail program, causes the virus to be resent to
the first 50 people in each of the user's address books. While it does not 
destroy files or other resources, Melissa has the potential to disable corporate
and other mail servers as the ripple of e-mail distribution becomes a much larger
wave. On Friday, March 26, 1999, Melissa caused the Microsoft Corporation to 
shut down incoming e-mail. Intel and other companies also reported being
affected.</p>

<font size="6"> <font face="helvetica"> </font> Big Data Presentation </p>
<font size="4"> <font face="helvetica"> </font>
<img src="images/Slide1.jpg" height="300">
<center> <p> The Big Data topic that I decided to present was Algorithmic 
Trading. Algo Trading utilizes inputted or imported data in order to analyze
 and determine if it should buy or sell a certain stock. It is able to 
 effectively trade this stock in a matter of nanoseconds, making it faster 
 than any human in this sector of the market. It uses Big Data by processing 
 past history and statistics on a type of stock and is able to determine how 
 successful or unsuccessful it was. It may have records of how well the stock 
 has done in past week or month. In my presentation I discussed how it works, 
 and how it often it is able to successfully trade in one business day. 
 I also mentioned how it related to Big Data based on the sole volume of 
 information being processed during and after each transaction or sale. Volume
 is also a big factor. These programs are able to purchase potentially hundreds
of stocks that pertain to a particular company, before its competators, and then
resale it to them for a profit. These algorithms are getting faster and faster
while still dominating a large section of the market. </p>

<font size="4"> <font face="helvetica"> </font>
<img src="images/Lawyer Pie Chart.png"
<center> <p> Our group decided that there was not an accurate repesentaion of 
data about the average employment a lawyer makes in the top five states. We used
BLS.gov to obtain raw data on the average annual lawyer employment, according to 
thier perspective states. Using Python, we created a pie chart that effectively 
represents the percentage of the employment for laywers in the top five states,
utilizing the location quotient as well. Using this pie graph, you are able to 
identify numerous factors, such as the top state with the hihgest employment rate
according to the location quotient, and how it has an inverse relationship with 
the employment rate of each state. The coding procedure for this program were 
relatively straightforward, as it was not too challenging to edit and display.

<font size="6"> <font face="helvetica"> </font> Simulaiton Modification </p>
<font size="4"> <font face="helvetica"> </font>
<img src= "images/Simulation mod.PNG"
<center> <p> This simulation modification was done using NetLogo. The simulation 
that me and my partner decided to edit and modify was the sheep and wolf 
predation simulation. My partner and I tinkered with tons of factors which 
significantly affected the outcome of the simulation, but we ultimately were 
able to tell which single facotrs caused the most change, and were the most
realistic. </p>
